### Hi there üëã

My name is Chris Park and I am a full stack engineer. I enjoy creating products from 0 to 1 and down the line, I would want to work in the health tech sector and ultimately allow doctors, practitioners, etc to allocate more time to patient care! 

üöß Two projects that I am currently working on:
  - Soundlens:
      - A project allowing for people to see their favorite aritsts' releases, in case they may have missed the initial drop.
      - I found that for myself, life happens sometimes and in this process, I sometimes get behind on new music and find it tedious to find the new music from all my favorite artists.
      - Techstack:
          - React Native & Expo
          - Firebase
          - Zustand
          - React Query
  - Creator Cards:
      - A project allowing for creators to display their social media links with style as well as measure their analytics.
      - I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to work on this cool project with @slip4k and we are looking to deploy soon!
      - Techstack:
          - Next.js
          - React Query
          - Supabase
          - shadcn
‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• My passions:
  - I am very big on fitness and weight lifting, specifically. I really enjoy the process of putting in hard work, and eventually seeing results! I also really enjoy meeting new people that come from different backgrounds and offer different perspectives.
  - I enjoy cutting hair and making others (as well as myself) look their best! It was something that I picked up after a bad experience at a salon, but it turned into a passion of mine that I used as a side hustle for myself in college!
  - I am getting into canvas painting through a friend of mine and am currently playing around with acryllics!
